# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor Class Challenge

This is a graded project ("Challenge") for Module 1 of the Uconn Coding Bootcamp course.  

Basic source code was provided for a presumably ficticious website landing page.  Although it was functional, it did not meet the Accessability standards for a Screen Reader or Browswer to read.

My assignment was to update the code in both HTML and CSS files to meet the following Acceptance Criteria:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptence Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## What I did in the project

I changed all the div elements to semantic elements to better describe what the div container was.  I then had to match the css code to the new element names.  

I added an ID for a corresponding anchor tag to fix a broken link in the nav element.

I made sure both HTML and CSS followed a logical progression in the same way the page was laid out.  The HTML page did not seem to need much re-ordering but I did move some groups of classes to be sure they were grouped together with others that targeted the same elements.

I made comments to better identify what section of code applied to which section of the website.

I updated the title to be the "Company Name" so that it appears on the browser tab at the top.
